## Apple Cider Vinegar
- Prep time: **6-8 weeks**
- Shelf life: **Indefinite**

### Ingredients
- Clean jar and fermentation weight or second smaller glass jar
- Organic apple scraps (peels and/or cores)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 cups filtered water
- Cheesecloth/coffee filter with rubber band or fermentation jar top

### Making
1. Fill your jar 3/4 of the way full with your apple scraps. Make syrup by dissolving 1 tablespoon of sugar into 1 cup of warm water. Pour syrup over the apple scraps until they are completely submerged. (Add more water if needed to cover scraps.)

2. Weigh down the apples with a fermentation weight or with the small glass jar. (Any apples that are exposed to the air could mold.) Cover with the cheesecloth / coffee filter and secure with the rubber band or use a fermentation jar top.

3. Store in a dark place at room temperature, like a kitchen cabinet, and let sit for about 3 weeks. Check on it every few days to make sure the scraps are underwater and that no mold is growing.

4. After 3 weeks, strain the apples scraps and return the liquid to the jar and re-cover with cheesecloth/fermentation cap. Put the jar back in a dark spot for another 3-4 weeks, stirring every few days. The vinegar is done when it reaches the tartness level you like. When ready, seal with lid or decant into a different bottle/jar and use as you see fit.
