# Decoctions
A very very strong tea. Can be prepared from an [infusion](Infusions.md) (read below). Can also be turned into a cordial (to extend their shelf life) by adding a little liquor.


>## Base Recipe from Infusion
>- Simmer infusion without lid over medium heat.
>- As soon as liquid starts to steam, set burner down to low and let it simmer until the liquid is reduced by half.
>- The steam evaporates and leaves you with a more concentrated liquid.
