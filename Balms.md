# Balms and Salves
Like a lotion, but a balm requires friction and must be rubbed or massaged into the skin for proper application. Mainly used to relieve pain and stiffness such as sore muscles or arthritis. Salves are thicker than balms and are sometimes used as an adhesive to apply further medicinal items.

## [Customizing Your Consistency](#freezer-trick)
In order to test the consistency of your balm, use the freezer trick:
1. As soon as the beeswax has melted, put a tablespoon of the mix on a plate in the freezer for a minute or two to check the consistency.

2. If you decide you want a firmer salve, add more beeswax. If you want a softer salve, add a little more oil.
