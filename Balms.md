# Balm

## Base Recipe
- 8 oz herbal infused oil(s)
- 1 oz beeswax
- 10-20 drops essential oil (optional)

Place oils and wax in double boiler and heat until melted. Remove from heat and add essential oil(s). Pour into containers while still hot.

> ## [Customizing Your Consistency](#freezer-trick)
> In order to test the consistency of your balm, use the freezer trick:
> 1. As soon as the beeswax has melted, put a tablespoon of the mix on a plate in the freezer for a minute or two to check the consistency.

> 2. If you decide you want a firmer salve, add more beeswax. If you want a softer salve, add a little more oil.
