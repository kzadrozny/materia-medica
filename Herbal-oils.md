## Calendula Oil
_From: Medicinal Herbs: A Beginner's Guide by Rosemary Gladstar_
- Prep time: **3-8 months**
- Shelf life: **Year**
- Uses: **Rashes, eczema, cosmetics**

### Ingredients
- calendula buds, dried
- olive oil (for medicinal) or grapeseed, almond, or apricot kernel oil (for cosmetic)

### Making
1. Fill glass quart jar three-quarters full with calendula buds. Fill the jar to within an inch of the top with oil of choice. Place the jar in a warm spot (near a sunny window is fine) and let sit for 3-4 weeks.

2. Strain and pour into a glass jar or bottle. Store in a cool, dark location, where it will keep for a year. Can be refrigerated.

**Variation**
For double-strength: When straining, add a fresh batch of calendula buds to the oil and let it infuse for 3-4  more weeks.

### Using
Apply to skin for rashes, eczema, or swollen lymph glands. Good for massage oil or for any cosmetic recipe that calls for oil.


## Calming Herbal Oil
- Prep time: **3-4 weeks**
- Shelf life: **Year**
- Uses: **For anti-inflammation and calming skin issues**
- Warnings: **For external use only**

### Ingredients
- Clean glass quart jar
- 2 parts dried rosemary
- 1 part dried violet leaves
- Apricot oil

### Making
1. Fill glass quart jar halfway with rosemary. Add violet leaves until jar is three-quarters full. Fill the jar to within an inch of the top with apricot oil. Make sure oil covers all the dried herbs; herbs exposed to air will grow mold and youâ€™ll have to toss the whole infusion out. Place the jar in a sunny spot and let sit for 3-4 weeks.

2. After 3-4 weeks strain and pour into a glass jar or bottle. Store in a cool, dark location.

**Variation**
Use portion of the oil to make a salt rub or skin balm.

### Using
Apply to dry skin. Good for massage oil.
